PiranhaCMS Bootstrap Template
=================

A Twitter Bootstrap template for PiranhaCMS. 
The idea behind this is to show you how to extend PiranhaCMS to cater for a Bootstrap style navigation.

You can check out PiranhaCMS here: https://github.com/tidyui/piranha

A demo version of the template is here:
http://ms.xqwzid.com.au/

To login to the manager, the credentials are (this applies for the demo and what you download from here):

<strong>username: admin</strong>
<strong>Password: admin</strong>

I will update this a little further later on to explain how the template works.
